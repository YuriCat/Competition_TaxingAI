# TaxingAI: A Dynamic Economic Simulator

Taxation and government spending are crucial tools for governments to promote
economic growth and maintain social equity. However, the difficulty in accurately
predicting the dynamic strategies of diverse self-interested households presents
a challenge for governments to implement effective fiscal policies.

We propose a MARL environment, named TaxingAI, for dynamic games involving N households,
government, firms, and financial intermediaries based on the Bewley-Aiyagari
economics model.
